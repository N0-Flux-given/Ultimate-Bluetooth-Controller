### What it is about:
This app is a tool to send commands to an Ardunio that has a HC05/06 bluetooth module attached to it. You can search and
connect to a bluetooth device from it and send commands like button press events to the Arduino from the app and use it to control cars or any other type of robots built with 
Arduino.
