# Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller
An app with a nice and clean UI to connect with and control an Arduino through the HC-05/06 bluetooth module.

### What it is about:
This app is a tool to send commands to an Ardunio that has a HC05/06 bluetooth module attached to it. You can search and
connect to a bluetooth device from it and send commands like button press events to the Arduino from the app and use it to control cars or any other type of robots built with 
Arduino.

### Usage:
You'll start off by getting a pop-up asking you to turn on bluetooth if it is off. Once you have it on, you'll be seeing this screen from where you can select the bluetooth device
connected to the Arduino.
